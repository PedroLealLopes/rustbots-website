              <p>Animated short-films/expansion of RustBots lore - Q1 2022
15-20 minute long animations focused on a main character (human) who sets on a journey with his RustBot. Animations introduce the RustBots Metaverse and establish a mental connection between the viewers, the main character, and all of the RustBots in this Metaverse. Animations will feature only minted RustBots and the owner of the RustBot will be able to collect a royalty for the use of their NFT in the films.
